## Background

Let's say you have survey data from a group of 28 municipalities. You
have worked out a [Quarto](https://www.quarto.org) file to generate nice
tables and figures and want to produce 28 different reports that all use
the same Quarto file for each of the municipalities. Additionally, you
want one collective report using the complete dataset.

Instead of creating 28 different .qmd files and running them manually,
this can be easily automated with parameterization. This will save huge
amounts of time, for instance when you find that typo in one figure and
need to re-render all 28 reports. Or, even better, when you get next
years survey results and can re-use the whole setup and instantly
generate your new reports!

## Setting up

In our simple case, we will only use one parameter, the name of the
municipality. Of course there could be any number of parameters that you
may want to customize, which you are likely to easily be able to do
based on this example.

We need to add two rows to the qmd-file YAML:

``` yaml
---
params:
  municipality: "All municipalities"
---
```

This creates the object `params$municipality` and gives it a default
value.

Next, we create our little script, in a file called `render.R`, starting
with a vector of municipalities. This could of course be read from a
file, and our example will only contain four.

``` r
municipalities <- c("All municipalities","Vallentuna","Vaxholm","Södertälje","Botkyrka")
library(glue)
library(quarto)
library(purrr)

walk(1:length(municipalities), function(i) {
  muni <- municipalities[i]
  
  outfile <- glue("{Sys.Date()}_{muni}.html") # gives the filename a date and the municipality name
  
  quarto_render(input = "yourQuartoTemplate.qmd", 
                execute_params = list("grupp" = muni), 
                output_file = outfile,
                output_format = "html")
})
```

> As you can see, we make use of `purrr::walk`, which means you may be
> able to use `furrr::future_walk` to enable parallel processing?! I

> looking into if you need to generate a lot of reports often.

### Final settings

Now, we just need to make sure that our Quarto file uses the params. For simplicity,
I expect that you read your data from a file into a dataframe. We will make use of a simple `if` and `else` combined with `dplyr::filter()` from the `tidyverse`.

``` r
# read data
df <- read_csv("yourDataFile.csv")

if (params$grupp == "All municipalities") {
  df <- df
} else {
  df <- df %>% 
  filter(municipality == params$municipality)
}
```

Save your files and run the `render.R` script! Files will be output to the same 
directory as your .qmd file.
