While the [RISEkbmRasch] package simplifies a lot of the analysis process for doing Rasch analysis in R, users still need to be able to import and make modifications to their data. This demands some knowledge in R data wrangling.

This page will be updated intermittently. The planned content includes:

- dividing a set of items into two or more dataframes in order to run separate analyses (for instance based on an exploratory analysis of a large item set)
- recoding/merging response categories
- splitting an item into two based on a DIF variable
- merging two items into a super-item/testlet

## Dividing a dataset

## Recoding response categories

## Item split

## Item merge
