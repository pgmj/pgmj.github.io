This is an introduction to using the [RISEkbmRasch R package](https://github.com/pgmj/RISEkbmRasch). A changelog for package updates is available [here](https://github.com/pgmj/RISEkbmRasch/blob/main/NEWS.md).

Details on installation are available at the [package GitHub page](https://github.com/pgmj/RISEkbmRasch). This vignette will walk through a sample analysis using an open dataset with polytomous questionnaire data. This will include some data wrangling to structure the item data and itemlabels, then provide examples of the different functions. The full source code of this document can be found either [in this repository](https://github.com/pgmj/pgmj.github.io/blob/main/raschrvignette/RaschRvign.qmd) or by clicking on **\</\> CODE** at the top beside the table of contents. You should be able to use the source code "as is" and reproduce this document locally, as long as you have the required packages installed. This page and this website are built using the open source publishing tool [Quarto](https://www.quarto.org).

One of the aims with this package is to simplify psychometric analysis to shed light on the measurement properties of a scale, questionnaire or test. In a paper recently made available as a preprint [@johansson], our [research group](https://www.ri.se/en/what-we-do/projects/center-for-categorically-based-measurements) propose that the basic aspects of a psychometric analysis should include information about:

-   Unidimensionality
-   Response categories
-   Invariance
-   Targeting
-   Measurement uncertainties (reliability)

We'll include several ways to investigate these measurement properties, using Rasch Measurement Theory. There are also functions in the package less directly related to the criteria above, that will be shown in this vignette.

Please note that this is a sample analysis to showcase the R package. It is not intended as a "best practice" psychometric analysis example.

You can skip ahead to the Rasch analysis part in @sec-rasch if you are eager to look at the package output :)

## Getting started

Since the package is intended for use with Quarto, this vignette has also been created with Quarto. A "template" .qmd file [is available](https://github.com/pgmj/RISEkbmRasch/blob/main/Quarto/RISEkbmRasch%20Quarto%20template.qmd) that can be useful to have handy for copy&paste when running a new analysis. You can also download a complete copy of the Quarto/R code to produce this document [here](https://github.com/pgmj/pgmj.github.io/blob/main/raschrvignette/RaschRvign.qmd).

Loading the `RISEkbmRasch` package should also get all the dependencies loaded. You may need to make sure that ggplot2 is updated to version 3.4.0 or later. However, it could be desirable to explicitly load the packages used, to simplify the automatic creation of citations for them, using the `grateful` package.

```{r}
library(RISEkbmRasch) # devtools::install_github("pgmj/RISEkbmRasch")
library(grateful)
library(ggrepel)
library(car)
library(kableExtra)
library(readxl)
library(tidyverse)
library(eRm)
library(mirt)
library(psych)
library(ggplot2)
library(psychotree)
library(matrixStats)
library(reshape)
library(knitr)
library(patchwork)
library(formattable) 
library(glue)
library(foreach)
```

::: {.callout-note icon="true"}
## Note
Quarto automatically adds links to R packages and functions throughout this document. However, this feature only works properly for packages available on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/). Since the `RISEkbmRasch` package is not on CRAN the links related to functions starting with **RI** will not work.
:::

### Loading data

We will use data from a recent paper investigating the "initial elevation effect" [@anvari2022], and focus on the 10 negative items from the PANAS. The data is available at the OSF website.

```{r}
df.all <- read_csv("https://osf.io/download/6fbr5/")
# if you have issues with the link, please try downloading manually using the same URL as above
# and read the file from your local drive.

# subset items and demographic variables
df <- df.all %>% 
  select(starts_with("PANASD2_1"),
         starts_with("PANASD2_20"),
         age,Sex,Group) %>% 
  select(!PANASD2_10_Active) %>% 
  select(!PANASD2_1_Attentive)
```

The `glimpse()` function provides a quick overview of our dataframe.

```{r}
glimpse(df)
```

We have `r nrow(df)` rows, ie. respondents. All variables except Sex and Group are of class `dbl`, which means they are numeric and can have decimals. Integer (numeric with no decimals) would also be fine for our purposes. The two demographic variables currently of class `chr` (character) will need to be converted to factors (`fct`), and we will do that later on.

(If you import a dataset where item variables are of class character, you will need to recode to numeric.)

### Itemlabels

Then we set up the itemlabels dataframe. This could also be done using the free [LibreOffice Calc](https://www.libreoffice.org/download/download-libreoffice/) or MS Excel. Just make sure the file has the same structure, with two variables named `itemnr` and `item` that contain the item variable names and item description. The item variable names have to match the variable names in the item dataframe.

```{r}
itemlabels <- df %>% 
  select(starts_with("PAN")) %>% 
  names() %>% 
  as_tibble() %>% 
  separate(value, c(NA, "item"), sep ="_[0-9][0-9]_") %>% 
  mutate(itemnr = paste0("PANAS_",c(11:20)), .before = "item")

```

The `itemlabels` dataframe looks like this.

```{r}
itemlabels
```

### Demographics

Variables for invariance tests such as Differential Item Functioning (DIF) need to be separated into vectors (ideally as factors with specified levels and labels) with the same length as the number of rows in the dataset. This means that any kind of removal of respondents/rows with missing data needs to be done before separating the DIF variables.

We need to check how the `Sex` variable has been coded and which responses are present in the data.

```{r}
table(df$Sex)
```

Since there are only 5 respondents using labels outside of Female/Male (too few for meaningful statistical analysis), we will remove them to have a complete dataset for all variables in this example.

```{r}
df <- df %>% 
  filter(Sex %in% c("Female","Male"))
```

Let's make the variable a factor (instead of class "character") and put in in a vector separate from the item dataframe.

```{r}
dif.sex <- factor(df$Sex)
```

And remove our DIF demographic variable from the item dataset.

```{r}
df$Sex <- NULL
```

We can now make use of a very simple function included in this package!

```{r}
RIdemographics(dif.sex, "Sex")
```

Let's move on to the age variable.

```{r}
glimpse(df$age)
```

Sometimes age is provided in categories, but here we have a numeric variable with age in years. Let's have a quick look at the age distribution using a histogram, and calculate mean, sd and range.

```{r}
### simpler version of the ggplot below
# hist(df$age, col = "#009ca6")
# 
# df %>% 
#   summarise(Mean = round(mean(age, na.rm = T),1),
#             StDev = round(sd(age, na.rm = T),1)
#             )

ggplot(df) +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = age), 
                 fill = "#009ca6",
                 col = "black") +
  # add the average as a vertical line
  geom_vline(xintercept = mean(df$age), 
             linewidth = 1.5,
             linetype = 2,
             col = "orange") +
  # add a light grey field indicating the standard deviation
  annotate("rect", ymin = 0, ymax = Inf, 
           xmin = (mean(df$age) - sd(df$age)), xmax = (mean(df$age) + sd(df$age)), 
           alpha = .2) +
  labs(title = "",
       x = "Age in years",
       y = "Number of respondents",
       caption = glue("Note. Mean age is {round(mean(df$age, na.rm = T),1)} years with a standard deviation of {round(sd(df$age, na.rm = T),1)}. Age range is {min(df$age)} to {max(df$age)}.")
       ) +
  theme(plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 0, face = "italic"))

```

Age also needs to be a separate vector, and removed from the item dataframe.

```{r}
dif.age <- df$age
df$age <- NULL
```

There is also a grouping variable which needs to be converted to a factor.

```{r}
dif.group <- factor(df$Group)
df$Group <- NULL
RIdemographics(dif.group, "Group")
```

With only item data remaining in the dataframe, we can easily rename the items in the item dataframe. These names match the `itemlabels` variable `itemnr`.

```{r}
names(df) <- itemlabels$itemnr
```

Now we are all set for the psychometric analysis!

## Descriptives

Let's familiarize ourselves with the data before diving into the analysis.

### Missing data

First, we visualize the proportion of missing data on item level.

```{r}
RImissing(df)
```

No missing data in this dataset. If we had missing data, we could also use `RImissingP()` to look at which respondents have missing data and how much.

### Overall responses

This provides us with an overall picture of the data distribution. As a bonus, any oddities/mistakes in recoding the item data from categories to numbers will be clearly visible.

```{r}
RIallresp(df)
```

Most R packages for Rasch analysis require the lowest response category to be zero, which makes it necessary for us to recode our data, from using the range of 1-5 to 0-4.

```{r}

df <- df %>% 
  mutate(across(everything(), ~ car::recode(.x, "1=0;2=1;3=2;4=3;5=4", as.factor = F)))

# always check that your recoding worked as intended.
RIallresp(df)

```

#### Floor/ceiling effects

Now, we can also look at the raw distribution of sum scores. The `RIrawdist()` function is a bit crude, since it requires responses in all response categories to accurately calculate max and min scores.

```{r}
RIrawdist(df)
```

We can see a floor effect with 11.8% of participants responding in the lowest category for all items.

#### Guttman structure

While not really necessary, it could be interesting to see whether the response patterns follow a Guttman-like structure. Items and persons are sorted based on lower-\>higher responses, and we should see the color move from yellow in the lower left corner to blue in the upper right corner.

```{r}
RIheatmap(df) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_blank())
```

In this data, we see the floor effect on the left, with 11.8% of respondents all yellow, and a rather weak Guttman structure. This could also be due to a low variation in item locations/difficulties. Since we have a very large sample I added a `theme()` option to remove the x-axis text, which would anyway just be a blur of the `r nrow(df)` respondent row numbers. Each thin vertical slice in the figure is one respondent.

### Item level descriptives

There are many ways to look at the item level data, and we'll get them all together in the tab-panel below. The `RItileplot()` is probably most informative, since it provides the number of responses in each response category for each item. It is usually recommended to have at least \~10 responses in each category for psychometric analysis, no matter which methodology is used.

Kudos to [Solomon Kurz](https://solomonkurz.netlify.app/blog/2021-05-11-yes-you-can-fit-an-exploratory-factor-analysis-with-lavaan/) for providing the idea and code on which the tile plot function is built!

Most people will be familiar with the barplot, and this is probably most intuitive to understand the response distribution within each item. However, if there are many items it will take a while to review, and does not provide the same overview as a tileplot or stacked bars.

```{r}
#| column: margin
#| code-fold: true
#| echo: fenced

# This code chunk creates a small table in the margin beside the panel-tabset output below, showing all items currently in the df dataframe.
# The Quarto code chunk option "#| column: margin" is necessary for the layout to work as intended.
RIlistItemsMargin(df, fontsize = 13)
```

::: column-page-left
::: panel-tabset
#### Tile plot

```{r}
RItileplot(df)
```

While response patterns are skewed for all items, there are more than 10 responses in each category for all items which is helpful for the analysis.

#### Stacked bars

```{r}
RIbarstack(df) +
  theme_minimal() + # theming is optional, see section 11 for more on this
  theme_rise() 
```

#### Barplots

```{r}
#| layout-ncol: 2
RIbarplot(df)
```

#### Expected Value Curves

```{r}
#| layout-ncol: 2
library(TAM)
tam1 <- tam(as.matrix(df), irtmodel = "PCM", verbose = FALSE) # run TAM Rasch Partial Credit Model on our data, which uses Marginal Maximum Likelihood estimation
plot(tam1) # create ICC plots
```

The expected value curves are made using the [TAM](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/TAM/index.html) package, which uses Marginal Maximum Likelihood (MML) estimation. It is a good way to check if any of your items may need reversed response categories, amongst other things.
:::
:::



## Rasch analysis 1 {#sec-rasch}

The eRm package and Conditional Maximum Likelihood (CML) estimation will be used primarily, with the Partial Credit Model since this is polytomous data.

This is also where the [five basic psychometric aspects](https://doi.org/10.31219/osf.io/3htzc) are good to recall.

-   Unidimensionality
-   Response categories
-   Invariance
-   Targeting
-   Measurement uncertainties (reliability)

We will begin by looking at unidimensionality, response categories, and targeting in parallel below. For unidimensionality, we are mostly interested in item fit and residual correlations, as well as PCA of residuals and loadings on the first residual contrast. At the same time, disordered response categories can influence item fit, and targeting can be useful if it is necessary to remove items due to residual correlations.

When unidimensionality and response categories are found to work adequately, we will move on to invariance testing. And when/if invariance looks good, we can investigate reliability/measurement uncertainties.

In the tabset-panel below, each tab will have some explanatory text.

```{r}
#| column: margin
#| echo: false
RIlistItemsMargin(df, fontsize = 13)
```

::: panel-tabset
### Item fit {.smaller}

```{r}
RIitemfitPCM2(df, 300, 32, cpu = 8)
```

Since we have a sample size over 500, ZSTD item fit values would be inflated if we use the whole sample. To better estimate accurate ZSTD values the `RIitemfitPCM()` function allows for multiple subsampling. It is recommended to use a sample size between 250 and 500 [@hagell2016]. We will set the sample size to 300 and run 32 subsamples. If you just want to test things out, I highly recommend lowering the number 32 to 4 to enable faster rendering.

For faster processing, `RIitemfitPCM2()` enables parallel processing with multiple CPUs/cores. You can check how many available cores you have by running `parallel::detectCores()`. It is recommended to not use all of them (leave 1 or 2 free). There may be issues with multicore parallel processing, especially when having few responses in some response categories. If you run in to errors, try increasing the sample size, or just use the single cpu/core function `RIitemfitPCM()` instead.

"Outfit" refers to item fit when person location is relatively far away from the item location, while "infit" provides estimates for when person and item locations are close together. MSQ should be close to 1, with lower and upper cutoffs set to 0.7 and 1.3 as default values, while ZSTD should be around 0, with default cutoffs set to +/- 2.0. Infit is usually more important. You can change the cutoff values by using options in the function, see `?RIitemfitPCM` for details.

A low item fit indicates that responses are too predictable and provide little information. A high item fit can indicate several things, most often multidimensionality or, for questionnaires, a question that is difficult to interpret. This could for instance be a question that asks about two things at the same time.

### PCA

```{r}
#| tbl-cap: "PCA of Rasch model residuals"
RIpcmPCA(df)
```

The first eigenvalue should be below 2.0 to support unidimensionality.

### Residual correlations

```{r}
RIresidcorr(df, cutoff = 0.2)
```

The matrix above shows item-pair correlations of item residuals, with highlights in red showing correlations 0.2 or more above the average item-pair correlation (for all item-pairs) [@christensen2017]. Rasch model residual correlations are calculated using the [mirt](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mirt/index.html) package. Again, you can set the cutoff value you desire in the function call, which will affect the values highlighted in the correlation matrix table and the caption text.

### 1st contrast loadings

```{r}
RIloadLoc(df)
```

Here we see item locations and their loadings on the first residual contrast. This figure can be helpful to identify clusters in data or multidimensionality.

### Analysis of response categories

The `xlims` setting changes the x-axis limits for the ICC plots. The default values usually make sense, and we mostly add this option to point out the possibility of doing so. You can also choose to only show the ICC plots for specific items.

```{r}
#| layout-ncol: 2
RIitemCats(df, xlims = c(-5,5))
```

Each response category for each item should have a curve that indicates it to be the most probably response at some point on the latent variable (x axis in the figure).

### Response categories MIRT

For a more compact figure.

```{r}
mirt(df, model=1, itemtype='Rasch', verbose = FALSE) %>% 
  plot(type="trace", as.table = TRUE, 
       theta_lim = c(-5,5))
```

### Targeting

```{r}
#| fig-height: 7
# increase fig-height in the chunk option above if you have many items
RItargeting(df, xlim = c(-5,4)) # xlim defaults to c(-5,6) if you omit this option
```

This figure shows how well the items fit the respondents/persons. It is a sort of [Wright Map](https://www.rasch.org/rmt/rmt253b.htm) that shows person locations and item threshold locations on the same logit scale.

The top part shows person location histogram, the middle part an inverted histogram of item threshold locations, and the bottom part shows individual item threshold locations. The histograms also show means and standard deviations.

### Item hierarchy

Here the items are sorted on their average threshold location (black diamonds). 95% confidence intervals are shown around each item threshold location. For further details, see the caption text below the figure.

The numbers displayed in the plot can be disabled using the option `numbers = FALSE`.

```{r}
#| fig-height: 6
RIitemHierarchy(df)

```
:::

### Analysis 1 comments

Item 18 has issues with the second lowest category being disordered.

Item 15 shows low item fit.

Two item-pairs show residual correlations above the cutoff value:

-   15 and 16 (scared and afraid)
-   17 and 18 (ashamed and guilty)

Since item 15 also had low item fit, we will remove it. In the second pair, item 18 will be removed since it also had problems with disordered response categories.

```{r}
removed.items <- c("PANAS_15","PANAS_18")

df2 <- df %>% 
  select(!any_of(removed.items))
```

As seen in the code above, I chose to create a copy of the dataframe with the removed items omitted. This can be useful if, at a later stage in the analysis, I want to be able to quickly "go back" and reinstate an item.

## Rasch analysis 2

### Analysis 2 comments

Items 12 and 16 are a bit low in item fit ZSTD.

Items 16 and 19 have a residual correlation at about 0.25 above the average level.

Let's look at DIF before taking action upon this information.

## DIF - differential item functioning

We'll be looking at how/if item (threshold) locations are stable between demographic subgroups.

### Sex

```{r}
#| column: margin
#| echo: false
RIlistItemsMargin(df2, fontsize = 13)
```

::: panel-tabset
#### Table

```{r}
#| fig-height: 3
RIdifTable(df2, dif.sex)
```

#### Figure items

```{r}
RIdifFigure(df2, dif.sex)
```

#### Figure thresholds

```{r}
RIdifFigThresh(df2, dif.sex)
```
:::

While no item shows problematic levels of DIF regarding item location, as shown by the table, there is an interesting pattern in the thresholds figure. The lowest threshold seems to be slightly lower for node 3 (Male) for all items.

The results do not require any action since the difference is small.

### Age

The `psychotree` package uses a model-based recursive partitioning that is particularly useful when you have a continuous variable such as age in years and a large enough sample. It will test different ways to partition the age variable to determine potential group differences [@strobl2015; @strobl2021].

```{r}
RIdifTable(df2, dif.age)
```

No DIF found for age.

### Group

```{r}
RIdifTable(df2, dif.group)
```

And no DIF for group.

### Sex and age

The `psychotree` package also allows for DIF interaction analysis with multiple DIF variables. We can use `RIdifTable2()` to input two DIF variables.

```{r}
RIdifTable2(df2, dif.sex, dif.age)

```

No interaction effect found for sex and age. The analysis only shows the previously identified DIF for sex.

### LRT-based DIF example {#sec-diflrt}

::: {.callout-note}
### Note
I advice not to use these LRT-based functions, unless you are certain that you understand their output. The `LRtest()` itself is fine, but the functions have not yet been extensively tested and may have issues depending on the dataset. It seems that the DIF size indicated by these functions may be inflated.

I wrote these when I found a bug in the `psychotree`-based functions that produced errors when mixing polytomous and dichotomous variables, but this has been fixed upstream now.

At some point I hope to find time to update the "old" DIF-functions with some of the nice things I implemented below.
:::

As of package version 0.1.16 there are four new functions for analyzing item location DIF. These are all making use of the function `LRtest()` from the `eRm` package.

We'll use the group variable as an example. First, we can simply run the test to get the overall result.

```{r}
erm.out <- PCM(df2)
LRtest(erm.out, splitcr = dif.group)
```

```{r}
#| column: margin
#| echo: false
RIlistItemsMargin(df2, fontsize = 13)
```

::: panel-tabset
#### Item location table
```{r}
RIdifTableLR(df2, dif.group)
```
#### Item location figure
```{r}
#| fig-height: 7
RIdifFigureLR(df2, dif.group) + theme_rise()
```
#### Item threshold table
```{r}
RIdifThreshTblLR(df2, dif.group)
```
#### Item threshold figure
```{r}
#| fig-height: 7
RIdifThreshFigLR(df2, dif.group) + theme_rise()
```
:::

The item threshold table shows that the highest thresholds for items 13 and 17 differ more than 0.5 logits between groups. In this set of 8 items with 4 thresholds each, it is unlikely to result in problematic differences in estimated person scores.

## Rasch analysis 3

While there were no significant issues with DIF for any item/subgroup combination, we need to address the previously identified problems

Items 12 and 16 are a bit low in item fit ZSTD.

Items 16 and 19 have a residual correlation at about 0.25 above the average level.

We'll remove item 19 since item 16 has better targeting.

```{r}
removed.items <- c(removed.items,"PANAS_19")

df2 <- df2 %>% 
  select(!any_of(removed.items))

```

```{r}
#| column: margin

### Analysis 4 comments

There are several item thresholds that are very closely located, as shown in the item hierarchy figure. This is not ideal, since it will inflate reliability estimates.

However, we will not modify the response categories for this sample/simple analysis, we only note that this is not ideal.

## Reliability

```{r}
RItif(df2)
```

While 11.8% of respondents had a floor effect based on the raw sum scored data, the figure above shows us that 41.8% are located below the point where the items produce a person separation index (reliability) of 0.7 or higher.

## Person fit

We can also look at how the respondents fit the Rasch model with these items.

```{r}
RIpfit(df2)
```

## Item parameters

To allow others (and oneself) to use the item parameters estimated for estimation of person locations/thetas, we should make the item parameters available. The function will also write a csv-file with the item threshold locations. Estimations of person locations/thetas can be done with the `thetaEst()` function from the `catR` package.

It can also be done by using the new (as of 2023-02-04) `RIestTheta()` function in this package (does not yet work with dichotomous data), which uses `thetaEst()` across all the participants in your dataframe.

First, we'll output the parameters into a table.

```{r}
RIitemparams(df2)

```

We can get more detailed information, such as the relative item locations and highest/lowest thresholds, by using the `RIitemparams()` function with the option `detail = all`.

```{r}
RIitemparams(df2, detail = "all")

```

The parameters can also be output to a dataframe or a file, using the option `output = "dataframe"` or `output = "file"`.

## Ordinal sum score to interval score

This table shows the corresponding "raw" ordinal sum score values and logit scores, with standard errors for each logit value. Interval scores are estimated using WL based on a simulated dataset using the item parameters estimated from the input dataset. The choice of WL as default is due to the lower bias compared to ML estimation [@warm1989].

(An option will be added *later* to create this table based on only item parameters.)

```{r}
RIscoreSE(df2)
```

Note that if your transformation table does not show the full range of ordinal sum scores, you can try to increase the option `sdx` from the default setting of `5`. Also, if you find the the default range of logit scores is insufficient, it can be adjusted by changing the option `score_range` (default is `c(-4,4)`).

### Ordinal/interval figure

The figure below can also be generated to illustrate the relationship between ordinal sum score and logit interval score. The errorbars default to show the standard error at each point, multiplied by 1.96.

```{r}
RIscoreSE(df2, output = "figure")
```

### Estimating interval level person scores

Based on the Rasch analysis output of item parameters, we can estimate each individuals location or score (also known as "theta"). Similarly to the `RIitemfitPCM()` function there is also a parallel processing version of the function available, which makes use of 4 cores by default.

`RIestThetas()` by default uses WL estimation of a partial credit model and outputs a vector of person locations on the logit scale. If you do not supply a matrix of item (threshold) locations, the function will use eRm's CML PCM to automatically calculate the item parameters based on the dataframe input.

```{r}
library(furrr) # for a parallel processing version of purrr::map_dbl
df2$personScores <- RIestThetas2(df2, cpu = 8)
```

`RIestThetas()` can also be used with a pre-specified item (threshold) location matrix. The choice of WL as default is due to the lower bias compared to ML estimation [@warm1989]. Similarly to `RIscoreSE()` you can change the range of logit scores, using the option `theta_range` (default is `c(-4,4)`).

If you would like to use an existing item matrix, this code may be helpful:

```{r}
itemParameters <- read_csv("itemParameters.csv") %>% 
  as.matrix()
itemParameters
```

As you can see, this is a matrix object (not a dataframe), with each item as a row, and the threshold locations as columns.

Finally, we'll look at the distribution of person scores using a simple histogram.

```{r}
hist(df2$personScores, col = "#009ca6")
```

#### Estimating individual measurement error

Each individual has a standard error of measurement associated with their estimated location/score. This has not yet been implemented as a function in this package, but can be calculated using the following code, using the `semTheta()` function from `library(catR)`:

```{r}
df2$personSEM <- map_vec(df2$personScores, ~ semTheta(thEst = .x,
                                                      it = itemParameters,
                                                      model = "PCM",
                                                      method = "WL",
                                                      range = c(-4, 4)
                                                      ))
```

The function `map_vec()` allows us to apply a function to all variables in a vector. As you can see, the first argument is the vector of estimated person locations, then we use the `semTheta()` function from `catR` to calculate the standard error of measurement for each individual. The `it` argument is the item parameters matrix, and the `range` argument is the range of logit scores. The range should match the range set when estimating the person locations with `RIestThetas()`, and -4 to 4 is the default setting for both functions.

## Figure design

Most of the figures created by the functions can be styled (colors, fonts, etc) by adding theme settings to them. You can use the standard ggplot function `theme()` and related theme-functions. As usual it is possible to "stack" theme functions, as seen in the example below.

You can also change coloring, axis limits/breaks, etc, just by adding ggplot options with a `+` sign.

A custom theme function, `theme_rise()`, is included in the RISEkbmRasch package. It might be easier to use if you are not familiar with `theme()`.

For instance, you might like to change the font to "Lato" for the item hierarchy figure, and make the background transparent.

```{r}
# first we need to remove the `personScores` and `personSEM` variable from the `df2` dataframe, to ensure that `df2` contains only item data before using it with the item hierarchy function.
df2$personScores <- NULL
df2$personSEM <- NULL

RIitemHierarchy(df2) +
  theme_minimal() + # first apply the minimal theme to make the background transparent
  theme_rise(fontfamily = "Lato") # then apply theme_rise, which simplifies making changes to all plot elements
```

As of package version 0.1.30.0, the `RItargeting()` function allows more flexibility in styling too, by having an option to return a list object with the three separate plots. See the [NEWS](https://github.com/pgmj/RISEkbmRasch/blob/main/NEWS.md#01300) file for more details.

In order to change font for text inside plots you will need to add an additional line of code.

``` r
update_geom_defaults("text", list(family = "Lato))
```

Please note that this updates the default settings for `geom_text()` for the whole session. Also, some functions, such as `RIloadLoc()` make use of `geom_text_repel()`, for which you would need to change the function above from "text" to "text_repel".

A simple way to only change font family and font size would be to use `theme_minimal(base_family = "Calibri", base_size = 14)`. Please see the [reference page](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ggtheme.html) for default ggplot themes for alternatives to `theme_minimal()`.

## Software used

The `grateful` package is a nice way to give credit to the packages used in making the analysis. The package can create both a bibliography file and a table object, which is handy for automatically creating a reference list based on the packages used (or at least explicitly loaded).

```{r}
library(grateful)
pkgs <- cite_packages(cite.tidyverse = TRUE, 
                      output = "table",
                      bib.file = "grateful-refs.bib",
                      include.RStudio = TRUE,
                      out.dir = getwd())
# If kbl() is used to generate this table, the references will not be added to the Reference list.
formattable(pkgs, 
            table.attr = 'class=\"table table-striped\" style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Lato; width: 80%"')
```
