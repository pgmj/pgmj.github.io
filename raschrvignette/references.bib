	abstract = {Throughout the mid to late 1970's considerable research was conducted on the properties of Rasch fit mean squares. This work culminated in a variety of transformations to convert the mean squares into approximate t-statistics. This work was primarily motivated by the influence sample size has on the magnitude of the mean squares and the desire to have a single critical value that can generally be applied to most cases. In the late 1980's and the early 1990's the trend seems to have reversed, with numerous researchers using the untransformed fit mean squares as a means of testing fit to the Rasch measurement models. The principal motivation is cited as the influence sample size has on the sensitivity of the t-converted mean squares. The purpose of this paper is to present the historical development of these fit indices and the various transformations and to examine the impact of sample size on both the fit mean squares and the t-transformations of those mean squares. Because the sample size problem has little influence on the person mean square problem, due to the relatively short length (100 items or less), this paper focuses on the item fit mean squares, where it is common to find the statistics used with sample sizes ranging from 30 to 10,000.},

	abstract = {Statistical analyses of Differential Item Functioning (DIF) can be used for rigorous translation evaluations. DIF techniques test whether each item functions in the same way, irrespective of the country, language, or culture of the respondents. For a given level of health, the score on any item should be independent of nationality. This requirement can be tested through contingency-table methods, which are efficient for analyzing all types of items. We investigated DIF in the Danish translation of the SF-36 Health Survey, using two general population samples (USA, n = 1,506; Denmark, n = 3,950). DIF was identified for 12 out of 35 items. These results agreed with independent ratings of translation quality, but the statistical techniques were more sensitive. When included in scales, the items exhibiting DIF had only a little impact on conclusions about cross-national differences in health in the general population. However, if used as single items, the DIF items could seriously bias results from cross-national comparisons. Also, the DIF items might have larger impact on cross-national comparison of groups with poorer health status. We conclude that analysis of DIF is useful for evaluating questionnaire translations.},

These statistics help inform researchers about how well items fit to a unidimensional latent trait, and are an important adjunct to modern psychometrics. Given the increasing use of Rasch models in health research the purpose of this study was therefore to explore the relationship between fit statistics and sample size for polytomous data.},
